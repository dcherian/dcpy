* My personal analysis tools

** Highlights
1. Has utility functions for reading various oceanographic datasets as xarray Datasets: see `oceans.py`.

2. Includes dask-aware port of the `seawater` library: see `eos.py`

3. Easy to use spectral plotting with easy switching between segment averaging, frequency band averaging and multitaper spectra: see `ts.py`

4. Some nice plotting functions (`oceans.TSplot`) and plotting utilities: see `plots.py`

** Warning

1. Everything is untested. Not all functions are dask-friendly. PRs welcome!

2. Almost no documentation :(.

3. Some are unpythonic ports of MATLAB functions I used but don't use anymore.

4. Utility reading functions in `oceans.py` have hardcoded directories.

** Required packages

- `cartopy`
- `mtspec` for multitaper spectra
- `seawater`
